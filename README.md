## Abstract

Accurate traffic forecasting is essential for urban traffic control, route planning, and flow detection. Although many spatial-temporal methods are currently proposed, they are still deficient in synchronously capturing the spatial-temporal dependence of traffic data. In addition, most methods ignore the hidden dynamic associations that arise between the road network nodes as it evolves over time. We propose a neural network-based Spatial-Temporal Interactive Dynamic Graph Convolutional Network (STIDGCN) to address the above challenges for traffic forecasting. Specifically, we propose an interactive dynamic graph convolution structure which divides the traffic data by intervals and synchronously captures the divided traffic data‘s spatial-temporal dependence through an interactive learning strategy. The interactive learning strategy motivates STIDGCN effective for long-range forecasting. We also propose a dynamic graph convolution module through a novel dynamic graph generation method to capture the dynamically changing spatial correlations in the traffic network. Based on a priori knowledge and input data, the dynamic graph generation method can generate a dynamic graph structure, which allows exploring the unseen node connections in the road network and simulating the dynamic associations between nodes over time. Extensive experiments on four real-world traffic flow datasets demonstrate that STIDGCN outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.
